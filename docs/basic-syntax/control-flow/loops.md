# Loops

!!!note "Loops"

    A loop is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be carried out several times in succession.
    The code "inside" the loop (the body of the loop) is obeyed a specified number of times, or once for each of a 
    collection of items, or until some condition is met, or indefinitely.
